## Introduction

This is the official API reference for the Apparatus extension â€“ an innovative
data-driven ECS framework for Unreal Engine.

This reference is better suited for a more advanced day-to-day usage during the development process.
Perhaps you should start learning Apparatus with the help of our [Manual](https://turbanov.ru/wiki/en/toolworks/docs/apparatus). You can also check out our sample platformer project which is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/toolworks/ApparatusPlatformer).
